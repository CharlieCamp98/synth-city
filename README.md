# Synth City

A free-to-play, browser-based, cyberpunk city simulation game. Build the city
of your (retrowave) dreams.

## Getting Started

Synth City is a browser-based game developed via the Javascript ecosystem. Please ensure
that you have the latest versions of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
installed on your system before continuing with setup.

First, install dependencies by navigating to the root project directory and running the following
script:
```
  npm install
```

Now you can run the game in development mode:

```
  npm run serve
```

More helpful scripts can be found in the **package.json** file.
